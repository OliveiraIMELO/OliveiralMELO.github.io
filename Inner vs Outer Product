# Understanding the Geometry of Matrix Multiplication: Inner vs. Outer Products

Matrix multiplication appears mechanical on the surface—multiply elements, sum them up, done. 
But beneath this computational routine lies profound geometric meaning that illuminates how vectors interact in space and how linear transformations reshape dimensions. 
The distinction between multiplying a row vector by a column vector (inner product) versus a column vector by a row vector (outer product) reveals fundamentally 
different operations that serve distinct purposes in linear algebra and its applications.


Before diving into the abstract mathematics, consider a practical scenario: a user-item matrix in recommendation systems. 
Imagine a streaming service where rows represent users and columns represent movies. Each entry contains a rating (or 0 for unrated items):

|        | Movie 1 | Movie 2 | Movie 3 |
| ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| User 1 | 5       | 0       | 4       |
| User 2 | 3       | 4       | 0       |
| User 3 | 0       | 5       | 2       |

This is where things start to get interesting. If you take a deep look at the tables, you will realize that in each row or column, there is an unrated item. 
If you already had some kind of relationship with linear algebra, you might wondering a few things: 

1. Could I collapse these 3 dimensional vectors into 2 dimensional vectors?
2. How to map the similarity between each user? How biased would it be? 
3. Could I map the similarity between each Movie with this current table? How biased would it be? 
4. Deeply What each row means? And each column? 
5. What storytelling this table can tell us?
